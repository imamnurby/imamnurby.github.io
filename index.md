## About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate at the School of Computer Science and Information Systems at Singapore Management University (SMU). I am a member of the RiSE Lab (Centre for Research on Intelligent Software Engineering) and conduct my research under the supervision of Professor [Lingxiao Jiang](http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/lxjiang/#gsc.tab=0) and Professor [David Lo](http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/davidlo/). Notably, SMU is ranked fifth globally in software engineering research according to [CSRanking](https://csrankings.org/#/fromyear/1970/toyear/2024/index?none&world).

My primary interest is domain adaptation for deep learning. At the beginning of my Ph.D., I focused on adapting language models for domain-specific code generation. This included projects on Trigger-Action programs (ICPC 2022, FSE Demo 2022) and Arduino applications (MSR 2023, ASE Demo 2023). Recently, as language models have become larger and more capable, I have shifted my focus to developing techniques for efficiently adapting these large models through fine-tuning and agentic workflows.
