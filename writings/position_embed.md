# Position Embedding in Transformer

Position embeddings are a crucial component in Transformer architectures. These embeddings provide crucial cues to the model about the relative positioning of each word within a sequence. Given that Transformers process tokens in parallel, they inherently lack an understanding of the sequential order. To address this, position embeddings explicitly encode sequence position information into the model. Various types of position embeddings have been developed, each offering unique approaches to integrate sequence order into the Transformer's parallel processing framework. This discussion will delve into several of these position embedding techniques, highlighting their mechanisms and contributions to the effectiveness of Transformer models.
