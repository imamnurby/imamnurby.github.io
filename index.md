## About Me

At the intersection of deep learning and software engineering, I'm crafting the next generation of intelligent code systems. As a PhD candidate at Singapore Management University's School of Computer Science and Information Systems, I'm fortunate to work within the RiSE Lab (Centre for Research on Intelligent Software Engineering) under the mentorship of Professor [Lingxiao Jiang](http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/lxjiang/#gsc.tab=0) and Professor [David Lo](http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/davidlo/).

My research focuses on applying language models to solve domain-specific challenges, driven by the belief that each task requires a tailored approach for optimal results. Through my dissertation, "Transformer-based Deep Learning for Code Generation and Translation," I tackle the complexities of leveraging neural networks for various code-related tasks. As language models continue to scale, I am also passionate about developing novel learning techniques that enable efficient adaptation of these increasingly powerful models. Beyond my research work, I actively contribute to the global research community, most recently by joining the BigCode community. I am fortunate to have the opportunity to help develop BigCodeBench, a comprehensive evaluation framework for large language models on coding tasks.

**I am actively seeking industry or postdoctoral positions where I can apply my expertise in applied deep learning**. My ideal role would allow me to bridge cutting-edge research with practical applications, continuing to develop efficient techniques for adapting large language models to specialized domains. If you're interested in discussing potential collaborations or opportunities, please don't hesitate to reach out via email.
